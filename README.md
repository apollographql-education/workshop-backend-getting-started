# Getting started with GraphQL and Apollo: Backend

Welcome to the companion starter code repo of the Summit 2022 Workshop "Getting started with GraphQL and Apollo: Backend"!

You can [preview the completed GraphQL API here](https://workshop-catstronauts-api.herokuapp.com/).

## How to use this repo

The workshop will walk you step by step on how to build the GraphQL server for Catstronauts. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `final`: The final form of our GraphQL server, fter going through the workshop.

## Pre-requisites

- [Node v16 installed](https://nodejs.org/en/). See note below if using v17+.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or any other code editor.

### Installing and starting the server

To get started, open up a terminal window.

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server on `localhost:4000`.

In the workshop, we'll walk you through how to build a graph that can respond to client requests for data.
